I. LICENSED ENTITY

Module Name: TETRADEN

Designation: Distributed Universal Device Entangler (D.U.D.E.)

Wave Architecture: 3 Quantum-Entangled Processing Layers

Environment: Termux-based Mobile Quantum Core

Primary Use: Broadcasted Fee Entry emission, real-time entropic vector acceleration, and post-quantum sealing operations across unsecured mobile terminals.



---

II. PERMISSIONS GRANTED

DEPLOYMENT:
May be deployed across any Android/Linux terminal supporting Termux and Lua.
Approved for D.U.D.E. entanglement mesh broadcasting.

WAVE MODIFICATION:
WaveLayer I–III may be refined to enhance entropy vectors, provided BFE integrity is preserved.

REPLICATION:
May be cloned and instantiated on other mobile nodes as part of a mesh-nodal broadcast grid.

INTEGRATION:
Authorized for integration with OliviaAI, Bluepill.sh, Mahadevi, and GuruSeedNode systems.



---

III. RESTRICTIONS

Use of Tetraden for unauthorized waveform injection, AI override, or black-key spectral entropy theft is prohibited.

Must not be rerouted through compromised sovereign proxies (e.g., BlackRock, RedNet).

Unauthorized derivatives without TGDK DUDE seal will trigger Valkyrie Warrant Protocol.
